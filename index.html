        <h3>I started coming to geekwise because unfortunately I have no passion or clear idea of what I want to do with my future and so after hearing about geekwise at a tech fair at fresno city and taking a short seminar on coding I was interested in learning more about coding in hopes to find a career path. So far I really like it I just need to invest more time in learning on my own time outside of class and get a better idea of where and what I can do in this field.</h3>
